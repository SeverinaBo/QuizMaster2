My app is on myMain branch, not on main.


QUIZMASTER WEB(inspiration from popular online quiz game "Kahoot")

This project was created using:
- Mui material template "Minimal Free â€“ Client & Admin Dashboard" (https://mui.com/store/items/minimal-dashboard-free/)
- React JS.(Client side)
- Spring Boot - REST API (Server side)
- H2 database to start the application.


How to start the application? 
Download git code and run:
| step - npm install
|| step - npm run.

The app is still in process. Now working on allowing to use your created questions in a game instead of default questions.
Screenshots to see how the app looks:
The app has two translations. Lithuanian and English.
We use Spring Boot and Maven for server side and React, Mui material template for client side.
